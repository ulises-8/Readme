- 👋 Hi, I'm Ulises, and this is my odyssey in programming and technology
- I started learning programming in October 2020 - when I signed up for an introductory programming course in Python at Foothill College
- I then took an intermediate-level course, and finally, an "advanced data structures and algorithms" class
- In total, there are 19 projects (10 intermediate, 9 advanced) in the Python repository that illustrate my perseverance, growth and progress in programming :muscle:

- I then took an Intro to Data Science course at De Anza College, where I fell in love wih extracting, analyzing and visualizing data.

- I didn't stop there. And I don't think if I ever will. This summer I took a Linux and SQL course. Thus getting me acquainted with OS, CLI, and databases.
 
- 👀 I’m very interested in software development, NLP, ML and data science
- I have experience in Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and NLTK
- In addition to experience in SQL and Linux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PL/SQL, AWS and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating as a software developer or data scientist at a company with ambitious goals
