- 👋 Hi, I'm Ulises, and I want to share my odyssey in programming
- I started learning programming in October 2020 (when I signed up for an introductory programming course in Python at Foothill College)
- I then took an intermediate-level course, and finally, an "advanced data structures and algorithms" class
- In total, there are 19 projects (10 intermediate, 9 advanced) that illustrate my perseverance, growth and progress in programming
 
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, NLP, ML and data science
- I have experience in Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and NLTK
- In addition to experience in SQL and Linux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PL/SQL, AWS and JavaScript
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating as a software developer or data scientist at a company with ambitious and goals
